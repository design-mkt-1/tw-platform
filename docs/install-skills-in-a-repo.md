# Prompt: install the tw-platform skill set in another repo

Paste the block below into a Claude Code session opened **in the target repo**.
It reproduces what tw-platform has: skills committed to the repo, plugins declared
in settings, and a `CLAUDE.md` that makes them fire automatically instead of being
optional.

Two things to adjust before you paste it, explained under the block.

---

```
Install the same skill and plugin set this repo's sibling tw-platform uses, and wire
them so they are always used, not optional.

1. SKILLS, COMMITTED TO THE REPO

Create .claude/skills/ and copy these 20 skills into it:

  graphify, explica, ro-scurt, design-system, make-interfaces-feel-better,
  frontend-design-direction, accessibility, frontend-a11y, react-patterns,
  react-performance, react-testing, frontend-patterns, motion-foundations,
  motion-ui, browser-qa, click-path-audit, verification-loop, taste,
  no-ai-slop, nextjs-turbopack

Source, in order of preference:
  a) ~/.claude/skills/<name>          (present on the owner's machine)
  b) .claude/skills/<name> from https://github.com/design-mkt-1/tw-platform

After copying, verify every skill has a SKILL.md, and verify .gitignore is not
swallowing the directory:

  git check-ignore -v .claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md

Empty output means it is tracked. Any output means .gitignore needs a negation
rule, otherwise the whole set silently never reaches the team.

2. PLUGINS

In .claude/settings.json, under "enabledPlugins":

  "ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill": true
  "ponytail@ponytail": true
  "caveman@caveman": true

These three are plugins, not loose skills: each ships a .claude-plugin/plugin.json
and activates through SessionStart hooks that run Node scripts. Do NOT copy their
skills/ folders into the repo. You would get the slash commands, silently lose the
automatic activation that is the whole point, and add roughly 45 MB.

Also create .caveman/config.json containing {"defaultMode": "lite"} and commit it.
caveman resolves its level as: CAVEMAN_DEFAULT_MODE env var, then repo-local
.caveman/config.json or .caveman.json walking up to the filesystem root, then the
user config, then "full". Pinning lite in the repo is what lets caveman and the
explain-in-plain-words rule coexist: lite drops filler and hedging but keeps articles
and full sentences, so it tightens explanations instead of truncating them.

3. CLAUDE.md

Write CLAUDE.md at the repo root, in English, as trigger rules rather than advice.
Cover:

  - Before any UI work: ui-ux-pro-max:design then ui-ux-pro-max:ui-styling;
    design-system when touching shared tokens or the Tailwind config;
    make-interfaces-feel-better for spacing, borders, shadows, hit areas and
    hover/focus states; motion-foundations before motion-ui; accessibility and
    frontend-a11y for every interactive control.

  - Before calling a UI change done: browser-qa, confirmed in a real browser rather
    than reasoned from the diff; click-path-audit for buttons, menus, tabs and
    drawers, tracing the whole state sequence and not just the click handler;
    verification-loop when closing out.

  - Answering questions about the codebase: graphify first. Explaining a bug or a
    decision: explica — plain words, at least one concrete named example from THIS
    project, and an explicit line between what was measured and what is reasoning.
    Never fill a gap with a plausible guess; name what is unknown and ask.

  - Writing code: ponytail (simplest thing that works, YAGNI, stdlib first, no
    unrequested abstractions), react-patterns, react-performance, react-testing,
    no-ai-slop, taste.

  - Bug fixes: understand why the bug exists and where it came from, then grep for
    every other place the same pattern appears. Fix the class, not the instance.

  - Language: conversation with the owner is Romanian; everything landing in a file
    is English.

  - caveman and explica together: explica decides what must be present, caveman decides
    how tightly it is written, and explica wins any conflict. The concrete example, the
    measured-versus-reasoning line, and naming what is unknown are all content and are
    never cut. Filler, hedging, tool-call narration and restating the question are.

Adapt the examples to THIS repo. Read its README, its git log and its src/ layout,
and cite a real incident from its own history. Do not copy tw-platform's examples.

4. THE OPERATIONAL LAYER — the part most CLAUDE.md files miss

Trigger rules about design and code are the easy half. The half that gets forgotten is
how the project actually runs, and it is the half where a wrong guess costs a deploy.
Before writing CLAUDE.md, read and then encode:

  - package.json scripts. Name the real commands. If there is a wrapper script with a
    non-obvious purpose, say what it guards against, not just what it does.
  - Everything in scripts/ or tools/. Read each file's header comment. These usually
    exist because something went wrong once, and that reason is the rule you want.
  - The CI workflow. Whatever it runs is the gate; list those exact commands in order so
    they can be run locally before pushing. Say explicitly whether a push deploys, and
    to what URL.
  - Build and runtime constraints — static export, no server, base paths, image
    handling, env flags. Write these as "do not propose X", because they are what an
    agent will otherwise suggest confidently and wrongly.
  - Where commands must run, if the repo is checked out more than once or dependencies
    live in only one place. Include any command that FAILS SILENTLY in the wrong place;
    a check that exits 0 without running is worse than one that errors.
  - Any directory that must never be touched by a bulk script, and why.

5. Do not commit anything. Show me git status and what you wrote, then wait for my
   confirmation.

6. At the end, tell me explicitly what you could not verify.
```

## Adjust before pasting

**Trim the skill list to the target repo.** The 20 above are tuned for a Next.js
frontend. In a repo like `repo1-reports`, which is report automation, `motion-ui`,
`react-performance` and `nextjs-turbopack` are dead weight. Cut them from the list
before you paste, rather than installing and ignoring them.

**Point (a) only works on the owner's machine.** `~/.claude/skills/` is local and is
not in any repo. On a colleague's machine or a fresh laptop, only source (b) works,
and only because this repo now carries the set.

## Known unverified

Whether `ponytail` and `caveman` load from `enabledPlugins` alone, or still need
`/plugin install ponytail@ponytail` run inside the target project. In this machine's
`~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` both are recorded against
`projectPath: D:\DesignTeamPlatform`, and plugins load at session start, so it cannot
be tested mid-session.

The check takes ten seconds: restart the session and type `/ponytail-help`. If nothing
answers, run `/plugin install ponytail@ponytail` in that repo.
