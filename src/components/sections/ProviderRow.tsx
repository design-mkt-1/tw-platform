/**
 * The Leading Providers row of Figma node 1:2649 (1280x340).
 *
 * Node 1:2657 stacks two `Slider-Track-Wrapper` frames (1:2658 and 1:2919), each holding a 1680px
 * row of 140px badges inside a 1280px clip — the design's way of drawing a marquee in a static
 * file. `.animate-marquee` / `.animate-marquee-reverse` in globals.css are those two bands; both
 * stop under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * Each track renders its badges twice. The keyframe translates by -50%, which is exactly one copy,
 * so the moment the first copy leaves the clip the second is sitting where it started and the loop
 * has no visible seam. Halving the copies would tear it every 40 seconds.
 *
 * Client because of one control: the search button in the header (node 1:5936) opens the row's own
 * filter — `ProviderSearch`, nodes 1:2220 and 1:4321 — and the badges below are then the studios
 * whose name contains what was typed. It used to open the *games* search, which shares nothing with
 * this row but the glyph. The store is deliberately provider-less, so this island can reach it
 * directly.
