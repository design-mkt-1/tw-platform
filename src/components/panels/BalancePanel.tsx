/**
 * The balance breakdown that drops out of the header pill — frame `Balance Opened` (1:4116),
 * popover node 1:4124.
 *
 * It renders the modal behaviour of `Panel` rather than its own: the trap, Escape, the backdrop
 * and focus restoration already live there and a second copy would drift. Only the geometry the
 * design asks for is overridden — 320px wide instead of the primitive's 360, radius 24 instead
 * of 16 — and those overrides carry `!` because two utilities of the same Tailwind family in one
 * class attribute are resolved by stylesheet order, not by the order they were written in.
 *
 * Where it lands is `Panel`'s decision too. Node 1:4118 puts the popover's left edge on the
 * balance pill's left edge, 8px below it, and `Panel` reads that pill at open time; the 320px
 * width is unchanged on a phone, where it becomes a centred dialog rather than a drop-down.
 *
 * The backdrop is `bg-overlay` and nothing else — the token is viewport-scoped in globals.css and
 * is not restated here, because a value copied into a comment is a value that goes stale the first
 * time the token moves.
