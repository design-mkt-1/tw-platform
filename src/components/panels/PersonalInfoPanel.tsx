/**
 * The menu that drops out of the username pill — frame `Personal information Opened` (1:4153),
 * popover node 1:4160.
 *
 * Despite the frame name it is a navigation menu, not a details form: the six rows are Wallet,
 * History, Invite Friends, Bonuses, Profile and Sign out. Nothing in the frame renders the
 * email, phone, date of birth or address that `user.json` carries, so this panel does not
 * invent a place for them.
 *
 * Glyphs are drawn inline rather than loaded through the `Icon` primitive. None of the six exist
 * in `public/images/icons/` and `IconName` cannot name them; more to the point every icon in that
 * folder is a flattened export with its own baked fill, so it could not take the row's hover
 * colour. The header already redraws its chevron and plus for exactly this reason. The exported
 * assets are requested in the report.
 *
 * As in `BalancePanel`, the modal behaviour is `Panel`'s and the backdrop is whatever `bg-overlay`
 * resolves to at the current viewport — see globals.css, not a value copied to here.
