/**
 * The account menu behind the centre action of the mobile tab bar: Figma nodes 1:8751 (pre-login),
 * 13:2307 (post-login) and 13:2519 (VIP).
 *
 * The post-login and VIP frames were rebuilt in Figma on 2026-09-09 and carry new ids; the two they
 * replace, 1:8260 and 1:8503, no longer resolve. Nothing in the repo can notice that on its own —
 * `screens.test.ts` checks the shape of a node id, not whether Figma still has it.
 *
 * One component, not three. The three frames share every menu row, the legal strip, the support
 * button and the chrome; they differ only in the block under the header — two auth buttons versus
 * a profile card — in whether the header shows a balance, and in whether Sign out is drawn beside
 * Support. Splitting that into three files would triplicate the eight menu rows, and the copy that
 * drifts is always the one nobody opens.
 *
 * Presented through `Sheet` so the focus trap, Escape, backdrop dismissal and focus restoration
 * come from the same implementation the desktop panels use.
