/**
 * The mobile twin of `PromoBanner` — nodes 1:6195 (tournament), 1:6247 (lottery) and 1:6282
 * (wheel) of the `mob main` frames.
 *
 * A separate component rather than a set of `mobile:` overrides on `PromoBanner`, because the two
 * are not the same layout squeezed: the desktop banner is a 1280x260 two-column frame whose right
 * column ends in a 180x44 button, and this is a 358x220 single column with the call to action
 * folded into a pill beside the countdown. Every box, every type size and the reading order
 * differ. One component drawing both would have needed a `mobile:` override on nearly every class
 * — and rendering the desktop one at 390 is what clipped the button off the right edge to begin
 * with.
 *
 * Two layouts live here, not three: tournament and lottery are the same card (1:6250) with
 * different copy, and only the wheel (1:6464) differs — stats at the top, a centred line of copy
 * and a full-width button, and no title at all.
 */

/**
 * A deliberate approximation, and the only value on this card eyeballed against the render rather
 * than read out of Figma.
 *
 * Figma crops each card to its own window — 1:6249 draws the source at 391% and pans it left — but
 * that crop cannot be reproduced, because the frame is fed a different, wider export of the scene:
 * its render is 4:1 where our banner is 1280x260, or 4.92:1. Covering a 358x220 box with ours
 * means scaling to 0.85 and showing 33% of its width, so the character comes out larger than the
 * design draws it, and nothing in `object-position` can shrink it. What the crop can still choose
 * is *which* 33%, and each banner wants a different one. All three are panned so the dark left of
 * the scene lands under the text and the artwork lands to its right — the tournament and lottery
 * under their titles, the wheel under its stat pills, which are the least legible thing on the
 * page over lit artwork. One shared number either buried the title under Zeus or put the wheel
 * behind the pills.

       * text and the join pill in the paint order, which is what a version bounded to the text
       * column could not do: at 106px tall on the lottery card and 140px on the tournament, it
       * either seamed under the subtitle or greyed out the pill.
       *
       * The wheel is excluded by owner decision (node 1:6282, do not touch), and it is the one
       * card that does not need it: its copy is amber on the dark left of its own crop.
