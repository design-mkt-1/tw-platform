/**
 * The Leading Providers filter — Figma node 1:2220 at 390, node 1:4321 at 1440.
 *
 * The design draws the same field in two places. On mobile it takes the row's full width and sits
 * under the section header (node 1:2221), in place of the magnifier that opened it: node 1:2222
 * has nothing left in that slot while the field is up. On desktop it is a 720px popover hanging
 * under that same magnifier.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `SearchInput`
 *
 * That primitive is node 1:4314, the *games* field: fixed at 48px, `pl-4 pr-3`, and its clear
 * control empties the query and leaves the field open. Nodes 1:2238 and 1:4322 are 44px at 390 with
 * `px-3`, and their close button is the only way out of the mobile field — there is no magnifier
 * behind it to press again. Two size branches and a behaviour flag on a shared primitive, to serve
 * one caller, cost more than the field below.
 *
 * Dismissal on desktop reuses `useOverlayBehavior` from Panel, exactly as `SearchOverlay` does:
 * Escape, outside press, focus trap, focus handed back to the magnifier. The inline form has
 * nothing to trap — it sits in the page flow rather than over it — so it handles Escape itself and
 * leaves focus alone.
