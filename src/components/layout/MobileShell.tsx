/**
 * The mobile chrome of frames 1:5720 and 1:6978: the bottom tab bar and the account menu it opens.
 *
 * Deliberately empty of content. Both mobile frames differ from each other only in the header, and
 * from the desktop frame only in layout — the sections themselves are the same fifteen — so this
 * wrapper owns the two pieces that exist *only* on mobile and leaves the page body to whoever
 * assembles it.
 *
 * A server component: it renders two client islands but reads nothing itself, so wrapping the page
 * in it does not push the sections client-side.
 *
 * `children` is optional. Phase 5 can either wrap the page (`<MobileShell>{sections}</MobileShell>`,
 * which gets the bottom spacer applied in the right place) or drop the chrome in on its own.
