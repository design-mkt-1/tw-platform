/**
 * The wins strip of Figma node 1:2438: an 80px card inside the page inset, holding 216px entries
 * separated by a 40px hairline (nodes 1:2440 … 1:2492).
 *
 * The design overflows past the right edge — the sixth entry is cut mid-word — which is the whole
 * point of a ticker: there is always more than fits. That is reproduced as a horizontal scroll rail
 * rather than a marquee: unlike the providers row, this strip carries names and amounts, and moving
 * text that cannot be paused is unreadable.
 *
 * The rail is focusable on purpose: a scroll container that only responds to a pointer strands
 * keyboard users in front of content they can see is there.
 *
 * The rules between entries are drawn here rather than by `RecentWinItem`, whose own `withDivider`
 * hairline is `border-strong` (white 10%). Node 1:2433 is white 15% — `border-emphasis`. Rendering
 * them as siblings inside the same `gap-3.5` flex puts them at the identical spacing.
