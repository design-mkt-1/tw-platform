/**
 * The primary nav, collapsed behind a burger between 768 and 1279 px.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The Figma file draws 390 and 1440 and nothing between, so the range in the middle — a tablet in
 * landscape, a small laptop, a desktop window that is not maximised — ran the desktop header
 * squeezed. Session 5 stopped it overflowing by letting the nav scroll inside itself. That made
 * the page correct and the menu unusable: measured on the deployed build on 2026-09-09, the nav
 * was a **33px window onto 569px of links** at 768 (the header rendered `CAS`, clipped mid-word),
 * 289px at 1024 and 544px at 1279. All six links were reachable by dragging a strip nothing
 * signalled was draggable.
 *
 * Four treatments were rendered and measured against each other at all three widths — accept it,
 * thin the 80px page gutter, drop two links, or wrap onto a second row. Only wrapping showed all
 * six at 768, and it cost 91px of header height. The owner's decision of 2026-09-09 is the
 * treatment none of the four were: **a burger**, which is what an online casino actually does at
 * this width, keeps all six links, and costs no height at all.
 *
 * ## Why not reuse `Sheet` or `Panel`
 *
 * Both are full-screen modal surfaces with a scrim, built for the phone menu and the header
 * popovers. A nav dropdown at 1024 is neither modal nor full-screen — dimming the whole page to
 * offer six links reads as an error state. It borrows `useOverlayBehavior`'s siblings instead:
 * Escape, an outside click, and focus restoration, which are the three things a dropdown must do
 * and the only three.
