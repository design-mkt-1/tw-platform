/**
 * The welcome-bonus banner. Two different compositions, not one that scales.
 *
 * Desktop — node 1:2436, 1280x340 inside the 80px page inset, 24px radius. Its child node 1:2437 is
 * a single bitmap with no text children: the "WELCOME CASINO BONUS" badge, the "£5500 UP TO 250 FS"
 * headline, the wager line and the blue GET button are all painted into the export. Re-typing them
 * as DOM on top of the image would show every word twice, so the copy is carried as `sr-only` text
 * instead — otherwise the whole offer would be invisible to a screen reader and to anything that
 * reads the page as text. The 3.76:1 aspect ratio is locked rather than the 340px height: below
 * 1280 the frame has to shrink with the artwork, and a fixed height would letterbox or crop Zeus.
 *
 * Mobile — node 1:5750, a 358x170 card inside the 16px inset, 16px radius. It is a genuinely
 * different layout, not the desktop one reduced: two separate pills instead of one, the amount and
 * the spins on two lines, sentence-case "Get", and the art cropped tall on the right. Here the text
 * is *not* baked into the artwork, so it is real DOM — which is also the only way it can be read at
 * 390px without the desktop headline turning into six illegible pixels.
 *
 * The two compositions have their own exports — node 1:5751 is the mobile card's own artwork, not a
 * crop of the desktop bitmap — and both are always in the DOM, with CSS hiding one. Which one the
 * browser actually downloads is decided by the two media-scoped preloads below rather than by
 * `priority`; see the note there.
