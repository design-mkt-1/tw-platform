/**
 * The modal surface behind the Balance and Personal information overlays.
 *
 * A panel that only paints itself is not a panel: without a focus trap, Escape, an outside-click
 * target and focus restoration, a keyboard user tabs straight out of it into the page underneath
 * and a screen reader never learns the page went modal. All of that lives in
 * `useOverlayBehavior` below, which `Sheet` reuses so the two surfaces cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The `right` alignment is a *popover*, not a corner: Figma draws both header drop-downs hanging
 * off the control that opens them (nodes 1:4118 and 1:4155 both place the popover at x=0 of the
 * trigger, y=48 of a 40px-tall trigger — left edges flush, 8px of air below). Pinning them to the
 * viewport corner instead put the balance breakdown 45px to the right of its own pill, underneath
 * the DEPOSIT button and the username. `useTriggerAnchor` measures the trigger at open time and
 * places the surface against it; see the comment on that hook for what happens when there is no
 * trigger to measure.

 * is deliberately left where it is — restoring focus wants whatever was focused, including the
 * cases below where it is nothing this hook can hang a panel off.)

 *  - the panel was opened with nothing focused: a deep link (`?panel=balance`), or the jackpot
 *    menu's "More" row, whose trigger is unmounted by the same commit that opens this panel;
 *  - the alignment is `center`, which is a standalone dialog and has no trigger by definition;
 *  - the viewport is a phone, where the fallback is a centred dialog rather than a corner. There
 *    is no "beside the trigger" on a 390px screen — the balance popover is 320 of those 390 and
