/**
 * A single exported glyph from `public/images/icons/`.
 *
 * `unoptimized` is not an oversight: every icon in this set is an SVG, and Next's image optimizer
 * rejects SVG sources unless `images.dangerouslyAllowSVG` is enabled in next.config.ts. Enabling
 * that is a project-wide security decision, so the primitive opts out of the optimizer instead and
 * serves the file exactly as it was exported.
 *
 * Scope: the small glyphs only. `public/images/logo.svg` is the 113x56 Jackpot wordmark and is
 * deliberately not reachable from here — `IconName` cannot name it, and `sectionIcon()` only ever
 * builds paths under `images/icons/`. The layout renders the wordmark directly.
 *
 * Each file is a flat exported fill, not a `currentColor` outline, so `text-*` on the caller does
 * nothing. A glyph that has to change colour on hover needs its chrome moved instead.
