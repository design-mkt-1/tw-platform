/**
 * Every image the app can ask for has to exist on disk.
 *
 * This is the one failure this project has already shipped twice. The sub-path deploy broke every
 * image at once, because `basePath` rewrites links but not an image `src`, and the page looked
 * perfect on the dev server the whole time. Separately, a bad Figma export left `search-btn.svg`
 * holding the entire page instead of the 20x20 glyph. Neither shows up in a type check or a lint
 * run: a wrong path is a valid string.
 *
 * So the suite walks in both directions — every path the code can produce must have a file, and
 * every file that ships must be one the code knows about.
